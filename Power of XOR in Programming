PLEASE READ THE CONTENT IN THE ABOVE LINK BEFORE SOLVING THE BELOW MENTIONED QUESTIONS:

ALWAYS REMEMBER NUMBERS ARE STORED IN REGISTERS IN PROGRAMMING

XOR Properties: (Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or)
I. Commutative: YES (i.e.  a XOR b XOR c = b XOR a XOR c = c XOR a XOR b and all possible combinations are true for
any number of operands)
PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Because of this property, we could solve the "find missing number" problem mentioned below in point(3).
II. Associative: YES (i.e. a XOR (b XOR c) = (a XOR b) XOR c

1. Swap two numbers without using temp variable:

2. Detect if two numbers have different signs
http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/detect-if-two-integers-have-opposite-signs/

3. Find a SINGLE MISSING NUMBER in a sorted array of size n where the array elements are from 1 to n.
(PLEASE note, only applicable for SINGLE missing number in a SORTED array of size n WHERE elements are from 1 to n)

5. Given an array in which all numbers except two are repeated once. (i.e. we have 2n+2 numbers and n numbers
are occurring twice and remaining two have occurred once). Find those two numbers in the most efficient way.
