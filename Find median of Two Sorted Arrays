Median
The middle number (in a sorted list of numbers). 

To find the Median, place the numbers you are given in value order and find the middle number.

Example: find the Median of {13, 23, 11, 16, 15, 10, 26}. 

Put them in order: {10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 23, 26}

The middle number is 15, so the median is 15.

(If there are two middle numbers, you average them.)
