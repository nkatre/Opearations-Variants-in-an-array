Defination of Median:
Wikipedia Definaton: The median is the numerical value separating the higher half of a data sample, a population, 
or a probability distribution, from the lower half. The median of a finite list of numbers can be found by arranging 
all the observations from lowest value to highest value and picking the middle one (e.g., the median of {3, 3, 5, 9, 11} is 5).
If there is an even number of observations, then there is no single middle value; the median is then usually defined to be
the mean of the two middle values [1] [2] (the median of {3, 5, 7, 9} is (5 + 7) / 2 = 6)

VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: Median can ONLY be found if the given collection is SORTED.
If the given collection is NOT SORTED, then we have to SORT IT, to find the MEDIAN

SUMMARY:
To find the Median, place the numbers you are given in sroted order and find the middle number.
Example: find the Median of {13, 23, 11, 16, 15, 10, 26}. 
Put them in order: {10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 23, 26}
The middle number is 15, so the median is 15.
(If there are two middle numbers, you average them.)
